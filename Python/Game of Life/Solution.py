# Problem: Game of Life
#
# According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life,
# is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

# Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0).
# Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
# using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):
#
#   1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
#   2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
#   3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
#   4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
#
# Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state.
#
# Follow up:
#   1. Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time:
#    You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
#
#   2. In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite,
#    which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array.
#    How would you address these problems?
